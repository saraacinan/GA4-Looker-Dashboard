# GA4 Looker Dashboard 

## Overview

Welcome to the GA4 Looker Dashboard project. In this project, I have utilized data from the **Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Demo Account** to build an interactive and visually engaging dashboard. The dashboard allows users to monitor key performance metrics across sessions, user behaviors, ecommerce activities, and demographic breakdowns, providing a comprehensive view of website performance.

## About Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Google's GA4 Demo Account and contains a variety of information related to user activity and ecommerce interactions. Here's a brief description of the data dimensions and metrics:

- **Sessions**: Number of sessions initiated by users
- **Users**: Number of unique users
- **Engaged Sessions**: Sessions with user engagement
- **Transactions**: Number of completed purchases
- **Total Revenue**: Revenue generated from ecommerce
- **Key Events**: Important user actions (view_item, add_to_cart, purchase, etc.)
- **Demographics**: User age, gender, and location
- **Landing Pages**: First pages visited during a session
- **Device Category**: Device type used (desktop, mobile, tablet)

> **Note:** This dashboard was developed using GA4 Demo Account data and has been adapted for use in multiple professional projects across various global brands.
